# Suz (sÊŒzi) a programming langauge for experimentation

This is a programming language for me to implement plt ideas I find 
interesting. 
The compiler does some basic type-checking (although I have not implemented all 
the checking I want, so the whole system is very unsound).
The parsed Ast is converted into a Tsr which representes the code while 
simplifying syntatic sugar. 
The Tsr is then lowered to llvm ir which is compiled to the binary using clang.
Because of this, beyond the requirements presented, it also requires clang be 
present on the system.

Below is an example of the syntax. 
A lot more syntax can be found in the `test.suz` file.

```
ext read_int() -> usize;

ext print_int(usize) -> ();

ext newline() -> ();

fun main() -> () {
    let a: usize = read_int();
    let b: usize = double(a);
    let c: usize = double(b);
    let d: usize = a + b + c;
    print_int(d);

    newline();

    let e: usize = read_int();
    let e: usize = sub_one(e);
    print_int(e);

    newline();

    let f: usize = read_int();
    if f == 1_usize {
        print_int(23_usize);
    }
    print_int(42_usize);
}

fun double(a: usize) -> usize {
    a + a + a
}

fun sub_one(a: usize) -> usize {
    a - 2_usize
}
