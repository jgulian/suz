# Suz (s åzi) a programming langauge to expirement

This is a programming language for me to implement plt ideas I find 
interesting. The compiler does some basic type-checking and then it translates
to a c-like ir with if-statements, goto, structs, unions, functions and 
pointers. This ir is sent to c++ to be translated to llvm ir to be compiled.
